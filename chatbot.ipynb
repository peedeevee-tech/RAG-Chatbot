      "Inside Out is a 2015 American animated coming-of-age film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. Produced by Jonas Rivera, it was directed by Pete Docter from a screenplay he co-wrote with Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley. The film stars the voices of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Kaitlyn Dias, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan. Inside Out follows the inner workings of the mind of Riley, a young girl who adapts to her family's relocation as five personified emotions administer her thoughts and actions.\n",
      "Docter conceived Inside Out in October 2009 after observing changes in his daughter's personality as she grew older. The project was subsequently green-lit, and Docter and co-director Ronnie del Carmen developed the story, while consulting psychologists and neuroscientists in an effort to accurately portray the mind. Development took five-and-a-half years on a budget of approximately $175 million. Significant changes to the film's story and characters delayed the film's production schedule.\n",
      "Inside Out debuted at the 68th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2015, and was released in the United States on June 19. It received acclaim for its craftsmanship, screenplay, subject matter, plot, and vocal performances—particularly those of Poehler, Smith, Kind, Hader, Kailing and Black. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Inside Out one of the top-ten films of 2015. It grossed $858.8 million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2015. The film was nominated for two awards at the 88th Academy Awards, winning Best Animated Feature, and received numerous other accolades. Philosophical journal Film and Philosophy recognized Inside Out as one of the best animated films ever made. A sequel, Inside Out 2, was released on June 14, 2024.\n",
      "Plot\n",
      "In the mind of a young girl named Riley are a series of personified basic emotions that influence her actions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Riley's experiences become memories that are stored as colored orbs and are sent into long-term memory each night. The aspects of the five most-important \"core memories\" within her personality take the form of five floating islands. Joy acts as the leader; because she perceives Sadness as an unnecessary burden for Riley, Joy also works to limit Sadness's influence.\n",
      "At the age of 11, Riley moves from Minnesota to San Francisco for her father's new job. At first, she has poor experiences: the new house is cramped and old; her father hardly has any time for Riley; a local pizza parlor only serves pizza topped with broccoli, which she dislikes; and the moving van with their belongings was misdirected to Texas and will not arrive for weeks. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness retroactively saddens joyous memories, causing Riley to cry in front of her class and creating a sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of this memory using a pneumatic tube, but accidentally knocks loose the other core memories during a struggle with Sadness, disabling the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are subsequently sucked out of Headquarters.\n",
      "In the absence of Joy and Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are forced to take control of Riley; they try to make happy core memories, but the results are disastrous, distancing Riley from her parents, peers, and hobbies. Without the core memories, Riley's personality islands gradually crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where things fade to non-existence as they are forgotten. Anger, intending to restore Riley's happiness, convinces Disgust and Fear that Riley should run away to Minnesota.\n",
      "While navigating the vast long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. After several adventures and mishaps, the trio catches the train, but it entirely derails when another island collapses. Joy, who is afraid all of the core memories will become sad, abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters. The ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and sending Joy and Bing Bong plunging into the Memory Dump. After discovering a sad memory of losing a hockey game that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her, Joy finally understands Sadness's purpose in alerting others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's song-fueled wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump. They are unable to fully ascend due to their combined weight, but Bing Bong sacrifices himself to save Joy by jumping out at the last moment.\n",
      "Joy reunites with Sadness, and they return to Headquarters, where they discover Anger's idea has disabled the console, putting Riley into depression as she boards a bus to Minnesota. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it and prompt Riley to return to her parents. As Sadness re-installs the core memories, transforming them from happy to sad, Riley tearfully tells her parents she misses her old life. Riley's parents comfort her and tell her they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory that is both happy and sad, and a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco. A year later, Riley, now aged 12, has adapted to her new home, made new friends, returned to playing hockey and has acquired new hobbies. Inside Headquarters, Riley's emotions admire her new personality islands and are given a newly expanded console that has enough room for all of them to work together.\n",

      "Pete Docter (left) and Ronnie del Carmen in 2009\n",
      "Development of Inside Out was green-lit in October 2009[1] after director Pete Docter noticed his daughter Elie becoming \"more quiet and reserved\",[2] and began to wonder what was happening internally.[3][4] Docter invited Ronnie del Carmen, who had worked as story supervisor on Finding Nemo (2003) and Up (2009), to join the project as co-director, a role del Carmen accepted.[5][6] They sought inspiration from their own personal histories and experiences,[7] and conferred with psychologists and specialists such as psychologist Paul Ekman and Dacher Keltner, professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, for accuracy.[8][9] While designing Riley's mental landscape, they consulted neuroscientists, and took cues from DNA strands and photographs of neuronal flashes.[1] According to Keltner and Ekman, the film emphasizes the ways emotions organize our thoughts and social lives, especially the role of sadness in fostering connections.[10]\n",
      "Twenty-seven emotions—including irritation, envy, greed, gloom, despair, depression, love, schadenfreude, ennui, shame, embarrassment, and hope—were considered for early versions of the film, but the number was later reduced for the sake of simplicity.[b] Ekman supplied a list of emotions—anger, fear, sadness, disgust, contempt, surprise, and happiness—and Docter decided to remove surprise due to its similarity to fear; he also removed contempt. Happiness was renamed Optimism and later Joy.[8][16][17] Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter offered little input to the film due to his focus on restructuring Walt Disney Animation Studios; it was the first Pixar film to be produced without involvement from the studio's co-founder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011.[2] The film's development process took five-and-a-half years[18][19] and had a budget of approximately $175 million.[20] Ralph Eggleston, Pixar's production designer since 1992, stated it was the hardest and longest film he had ever worked on.[19] As a result, first-time directors were considered ineligible to work on the film.[21]\n",
      "Writing\n",
      "The filmmakers were responsible for expressing the characters' personal traits, talents,[11] and contrasts.[26] Inside Out's design team researched more of Riley's personality's distinct directions after Docter became concerned over Joy's displeasure. Designer Albert Lozano wanted Joy to be tomboyish and mischievous.[32] Amy Poehler helped the team write Joy, illustrating a broad range of happiness after facing difficulties. With LeFauve's help, the team envisioned Joy as a vulnerable, intangible character because she is \"unapologetically positive\".[22][33] From the outset, the idea of Joy's potential to excessively manipulate youth, persisted, setting off Riley's \"social storms\".[34]\n",
      "In one instance, Riley was to have wanted the lead role as a turkey in a Thanksgiving Day pageant; Docter found that plot idea to be too unfamiliar and sought something to replace it. Several drafts emerged, including the characters cultivating ideas after falling to \"Idea Fields\";[35] in another, Bing Bong would recruit at a large, exiled entourage of characters from Riley's childhood. Richard Kind later defined his character as \"the fading of childhood\" when Inside Out's development had progressed.[36] In October 2011, Diane Disney Miller persuaded Docter to reduce Inside Out's distractions and reprioritize the story.[22] Docter determined the concept of personality islands could integrate the mind world's geography and story.[35]\n",
      "In 2012, the film was put into production[1] after several screenings and suggestions, and was evaluated after three months. Editor Kevin Nolting said seven versions of the film were created before the production began.[31] Balancing the film's tone, for example, viewers' responses to Joy's cheerful nature while feeling negative about the mess Joy manipulates in Riley, was difficult. Producer Jonas Rivera credited Poehler for developing these aspects of Joy's nature.[34] Eggleston recommended setting the film in Riley's mind rather than in her brain,[37] and a few scenes about the brain were dropped.[11]\n",
      "Pixar filmmakers held an evaluation screening of the film in July 2012. An early version of Inside Out focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together. Docter deemed this problematic and determined the idea about Joy had learned from Fear to develop her characterization, before deciding to integrate emotions and relationships within the film. Instead, Sadness replaced Fear to have a \"much juicier\" role.[11][38] Docter's altercation between Joy and Sadness lacked the film's emotional ending. To address the issue, he changed a scene where Riley is separating from her friend in its subsequent portions. Islands of Friendship and Personality became Joy and Sadness's outings in the film to maintain its continuity.[39]\n",
      "Casting\n",
      "Inside Out's principal characters were cast in August 2013.[41] \n",
      "Eggleston was tasked with outlining the mind and real worlds through design briefs. The mind world incorporates soft surfaces, increased use of saturated colors and contrasty light, and translucency whereas the real world uses opposite attributes.[19] The worlds' design resembles those of Pixar films Up and Toy Story 3 (2010),[16] the romantic drama One from the Heart (1982), David Hockney's theatrical productions,[53] and the intended 1950s Broadway musicals.[2] Supervising animator Victor Navone tightened the design's aspects,[16] which were emphasized by freeform surface modeling.[54] Around 300 designs of Headquarters were developed.[1] Decoding how to depict the mind's interior, the filmmakers concentrated on the word \"electrochemical\" and considered options using electricity.[55]\n",
      "Character designs underwent several revisions before they were finalized. Simple shapes were initially designed; these included Anger as a brick, Joy as a star, Sadness as a tear, and Fear as a nerve. Sadness's appearance was eventually changed to that of Debbie Downer. Lozano planned to dress Sadness in pajamas to highlight her depression. Disgust's and Anger's approaches were respectively based on April Ludgate and Hades from Hercules (1997). To avoid similarities to Tinker Bell, Joy was given a green dress and her hair color was changed to blue. After Pixar presented potential designs of Riley to the audience, Lozano thought the character looked like Elie.[52][56]\n",
      "Animation\n",
      "Animation of Inside Out took a year and a half. About 48 animators, including supervisors Shawn Krause and Navone, and director Jamie Roe and 350 artists—35 of them lighting–led by cinematographer Kim White–and 10 layout—and technicians were involved in the production. Two animation teams were assembled: one for the abstract sequence and another involving crowd simulation for the character groupings.[16][18] They used novel technology to locate every part of the human body.[57]\n",
      "Docter imagined with emotions for characters, they could \"push the level of caricature\" to both design and style of movement. To this end, they emulated the animation styles of Tex Avery and Chuck Jones.[35] Docter informed Krause and Navone to push the graphic caricature of each character rather than sticking to the rigid behavior of each RenderMan model. This required an artist to draw over characters in Inside Out using a Wacom Cintiq during dailies.[58] After the characters' forms were finalized, they were proposed for 3D models using desktop computers. The filmmakers studied dailies until Docter gave the film's finalized shots approval on lighting and rendering.[1]\n",
      "Inside Out made increased use of an advanced sketching tool with which animators performed rapid sculpting on silhouettes, altering the characters' appearances and evaluating a \"fine-tuning\" cloth stimulation.[59] Through the simulation department, the motion of the characters' hair and garments was added.[11] Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull felt the characters' attributes have to a lesser extent humanoid forms, bright colors, and strange shapes due to their possession of force fields.[60] All aspects of Inside Out were eventually merged into a single image,[11] becoming an animation spread across 1,600 shots. Each three seconds of footage took three weeks to create[1] and 33 hours to render.[60]\n",
      "Both animation teams handled the transition of Joy from a \"complete abstract\" to an \"animatable character\".[61] Lighting Joy was Eggleston's early inspiration through his production design. Eggleston's pastel diagram shaped Joy, increasing her illumination[62] and making her Pixar's crucial character. Instead of being solid, Joy's effervescence was derived from pinwheels, Champagne, and sparklers. Lozano thought Joy looked like Audrey Hepburn.[1] For Joy to become brightened, the RenderMan team developed geometrical optics,[62] and Docter suggested designing her with \"sprite-like and golden\" modifications.[30] These effects function dependably due to Joy's typical type. Over 750 shots were made using artistic performance and lighting cinematography.[61] The filmmakers worked on Joy's aura for eight months but encountered difficulties with time and budget. Lasseter requested that it be applied for each emotion instead. Eggleston described this technique, saying \"You could hear the core technical staff just hitting the ground, the budget falling through the roof\".[63] Docter and his six-designer team spent approximately 18 months finalizing Joy's look.[32] The process of making Joy took three years.[30]\n",
      "Music and sound design\n",
      "\n",
      "Composer Michael Giacchino in 2017\n",
      "Michael Giacchino composed the music for Inside Out.[67] He began planning in January 2015[68] and concluded in May 2015.[1] While in the music session, Docter felt its score was \"bittersweet\" and \"nostalgic\".[22] Giacchino wanted to create something more emotionally monumental for Inside Out than his score from Up.[68] The producers first met with Giacchino to discuss the film's concept and screen it for him. In response, Giacchino composed an eight-minute suite of music, unconnected to the film, based on his emotions viewing it. Rivera said because both Giacchino and Docter were musicians, they discussed the film in terms of story and character.[35] In accordance with his creative preference, sound designer Ren Klyce created a progressive soundscape.[69] Audio mixing was done to harmonize \"dense\" sounds for the film's beginning scene. The introduction of Joy uses a single sound.[70]\n",
      "Release\n",
      "Marketing\n",
      "Marketing Inside Out was considered difficult despite the enthusiasm of executives at Disney and Pixar for the film.[38] Writing for The Washington Post, Kristen Page-Kirby described this as \"absolutely screwed\".[71] Disney's marketing strategy included an active social media campaign,[72] a worldwide publicity tour,[73] and the creation of five colorful character posters.[74] Kind did not take part in Inside Out's marketing because the producers decided to keep Bing Bong a secret.[48] As a result, the character was excluded from the film's promotion to focus on the emotion characters. Docter considered Kind's decision \"smart\", recognizing Bing Bong was a \"surprise to the audience\".[75][76] In the run-up to its release, the film was test-screened for children because executives were worried about its appeal to young viewers.[33] Disney Infinity 3.0 added a platformer-type Inside Out playset featuring all five emotion characters as playable characters.[77][78] A mobile Puzzle Bobble-style game titled Inside Out: Thought Bubbles was released.[79][80]\n",
      "The 95-minute film Inside Out debuted in a competition at the 68th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2015,[81][82] followed by a premiere on June 8 at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles.[83] In the event at Cannes, the film received an eight-minute standing ovation.[84][85] Inside Out was also released in Dolby Vision, making it one of the earliest films to adopt the format.[86] In theaters, it was accompanied by a short film called Lava (2014).[87]\n",
      "Inside Out was initially scheduled for release on May 30, 2014,[88] but was postponed to June 19, 2015.[89] During its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, Inside Out grossed $90.4 million across 3,946 theaters, 3,100 of which were in 3D, debuting at number two behind Jurassic World ($106.6 million).[90] This revenue included $3.7 million from Thursday night previews.[91] The weekend-total figure made Inside Out the first Pixar film not to debut at number one,[92] the biggest number-two debut of all time (surpassing The Day After Tomorrow), and the largest opening weekend for any original film (surpassing Avatar), and was Pixar's second-biggest opening after Toy Story 3.[93] Inside Out's successful opening was attributed to its Cannes premiere, CinemaCon, and Fathom Events screenings, favorable critical reception and word-of-mouth, and its release over the Father's Day weekend. It primarily drew a mostly female audience and approximately 71 percent of the viewers were families.[94][95][96] The film grossed $52.1 million in its second weekend—a reduction of 42 percent—and $29.3 million in its third.[97][98] After finishing its theatrical run on December 10, 2015, Inside Out had grossed $356.9 million in the U.S. and Canada as the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year.[99][100] In July 2020, due to the worldwide closure of cinemas during the COVID-19 pandemic and limits on which films played, Inside Out returned to 442 theaters—mostly drive-ins—and grossed $340,000.[101]\n",
      "Outside the U.S. and Canada, Inside Out grossed $40.3 million during its opening weekend in 37 markets.[102] Its top-grossing markets were China at $11.7 million,[103] the United Kingdom at $11.5 million,[104] Mexico at $8.6 million, Russia at $7.6 million,[102] Italy at $7.4 million,[105] Germany at $7.1 million,[106] and South Korea at $5.2 million. Inside Out was the first Pixar film to gross over one billion rubles in Russia.[107] The film grossed a further $501.9 million, its highest grosses coming from the United Kingdom ($59.4 million), Japan ($33 million), Germany ($31.6 million), Mexico ($31.1 million), South Korea ($30.9 million), France ($30.1 million), Italy ($27.1 million), Venezuela ($25.4 million), and Australia ($24.2 million).[99] This made it the seventh-highest-grossing film outside the U.S. and Canada,[108] and the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2015 with a total gross of $858.8 million.[109] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $279.51 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participation, and other costs; box-office grosses and home-media revenues placed it sixth on their list of 2015's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[20]\n",
      "Reception\n",
      "Critical response\n",
      "Inside Out received critical acclaim,[d] and was listed on many critics' top-ten lists in 2015.[129] It has an approval rating of 98% based on 384 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.9/10. The consensus reads, \"Inventive, gorgeously animated, and powerfully moving, Inside Out is another outstanding addition to the Pixar library of modern animated classics\".[130] \n",
      "Critics praised Inside Out's craftsmanship and Docter's direction,[e] describing it as a return to form for Pixar.[f] Peter Debruge (Variety), Kenneth Turan (Los Angeles Times), and Todd McCarthy (The Hollywood Reporter) praised the film. Debruge and Turan described it as Pixar's best, calling it \"sophisticated\" and \"audacious\". \n",
      "Accolades\n",
      "\n",
      "At the 88th Academy Awards, Inside Out received a nomination for Best Original Screenplay and won Best Animated Feature.[166] Its other nominations include fourteen Annie Awards (winning ten),[167] two British Academy Film Awards (winning one),[168] three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning one),[169] and a Golden Globe Award (which it won).[170] The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Inside Out one of the ten-best films of 2015; it also won the National Board of Review's Best Animated Film award.[171][172]\n",
      "Post-release\n",
      "Thematic analysis\n",
      "A central theme of Inside Out is the consequences and portrayal of emotions and memories.[173][174][175] Those depicted in the film are \"honest\" and \"generous\";[174][176] their goal is maintaining Riley's life.[177] Natasha Moore of the Australian ABC News said of the film's theme: \"[If] Riley's carefree life gets more complicated, ... Joy's attempts to deliver uninterrupted happiness become increasingly neurotic\".[178] Nicole Markotic said the film explores the relationship between \"the many and the one\", demonstrating people have \"composite\" personalities. The different components of one person's personality are vital for that person's \"emotional and psychological balance\". Depression and sadness are distinct in the film; this distinction is meant to \"[offer] individuals strategies to avoid suppressing crucial feelings\".[179] Writing in the British Journal of Psychiatry, Hannah Marcarian and Paul O. Wilkinson said this validation of different emotions helps people express themselves.[180]\n",
      "Ruth Bettelheim of USA Today wrote human responses to physical and social environments evolved over millions of years and are yet fully understood, as shown by the film's omission of Riley's bodily sensations and their possible effect on mental states. Primatologist Louise Barrett said the film shows disconnection between characters who are not relating to each other or to their own emotions but moments of personal harmony lead to positive interpersonal connections.[181] According to USA Today's Jamie Altman, Inside Out shows major environmental changes can be \"difficult, but not impossible, to overcome\", recommending it to college students experiencing homesickness or sadness.[182]\n",
      "Lawsuits\n",
      "Three lawsuits followed Inside Out's release. Pediatrician Denise Daniels sued Disney and Pixar in 2017, claiming the film's personified emotions infringed on her pitch for a television series called The Moodsters.[183] Two similar suits followed in 2018; author Carla J. Masterson sued Disney for infringing her books What’s on the Other Side of the Rainbow? and The Secret of the Golden Mirror,[184] and another was brought in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by a Canadian student Damon Pourshian, who had made a film titled Inside Out.[185][186] Pourshian's suit was approved by an Ontario court in 2021.[187] The outcomes of these lawsuits is unknown[184][187] and Daniels' was rejected.[188]\n",
      "Legacy\n",
      "In 2015, Google started a Made with Code event for Inside Out named \"Inside HQ\" to encourage children, especially girls, to study programming.[203] Worldwide, it was among the top entertainment Google searches of 2015.[204][205] The film is referenced in the television series The Simpsons.[206][207] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Inside Out was one of the 35 films recommended by The Independent.[208]\n",
      "Inside Out inspired several Internet memes. A meme implying a similarity between Joy and Disgust and the Philippine supercouple nicknamed AlDub was posted on social media in 2015.[209] Riley's mother and maternal characters from other Pixar films were shown in a buttocks-themed \"Dump-Truck\" meme.[210]\n",
      "The concept of \"core memories\" became an expression used among Gen Z and later a trend on video-sharing service TikTok in mid-2022.[211][212]\n",
      "Sequel\n",
      "Main article: Inside Out 2\n",
      "Docter was germinating ideas for an Inside Out sequel while the original film's nominations were unveiled at the 88th Academy Awards in January 2016.[213] Disney began development with an announcement at the D23 Expo in 2022.[214] Kelsey Mann took over as the sequel's director and implemented Docter's \"five to 27 emotions\" idea.[12][215] The sequel, Inside Out 2, was released on June 14, 2024.[214]\n",
      "Television series\n",
      "A television series based on Inside Out is in development at Pixar. Soul co-writer Mike Jones will develop the series.[216] The series, titled Dream Productions, will premiere on Disney+ in 2025.[217]\n",

      "Inside Out 2 is a 2024 American animated coming-of-age film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The sequel to Inside Out (2015), it was directed by Kelsey Mann (in his feature directorial debut) and produced by Mark Nielsen, from a screenplay written by Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein, and a story conceived by Mann and LeFauve. Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan reprise their roles from the first film, with Maya Hawke, Kensington Tallman, Tony Hale, Liza Lapira, Ayo Edebiri, Lilimar, Grace Lu, Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green, Adèle Exarchopoulos, and Paul Walter Hauser joining the cast. The film tells the story of Riley's emotions as they find themselves joined by new emotions that want to take over Riley's head.\n",
      "First announced in September 2022 during the D23 Expo, Inside Out 2 features Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter's \"five to 27 emotions\" idea from the first film that Mann pitched during its production to utilize \"truthful\" worldbuilding.\n",
      "Inside Out 2 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on June 10, 2024, and was released in theaters in the United States on June 14. The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $761.9 million worldwide. It had the third-biggest domestic opening weekend for an animated film, and is the highest-grossing film of 2024.\n",
      "Plot\n",
      "Two years after her move to San Francisco,[c] Riley, now 13, is about to enter high school. Her personified emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust — have since overseen a newly-formed element of Riley's mind called her \"Sense of Self\", which houses memories and feelings that form Riley's beliefs. Joy, intending to fill the Sense of Self with only positive memories, has invented a mechanism that launches any negative memories to the back of Riley's mind. Riley and her best friends Bree and Grace are invited to a weekend ice hockey camp where Riley hopes to qualify for her school's team, the Firehawks. On the night before the camp, a \"Puberty Alarm\" sounds off, and a group of mind workers barge into Headquarters to upgrade the emotion console.\n",
      "The emotions discover that Riley wildly overreacts to any inputs they make to the console. Four new emotions also arrive at Headquarters and introduce themselves: Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui. Though initially friendly, the new and old emotions clash over their approaches; in particular, Joy thinks Riley should focus on having fun at the camp, while Anxiety wants Riley to win a spot on the team and make new friends, especially after learning that Bree and Grace will be attending a different high school.\n",
      "While being led by Joy, Riley inadvertently causes the campers to be collectively punished by the camp's strict director, Coach Roberts. Feeling that Riley needs to change her personality to fit in with the older players, Anxiety dumps the Sense of Self into the back of Riley's mind and has the old emotions captured and thrown into a memory vault. She and the other new emotions then use negative memories to create a new, anxiety-focused Sense of Self and encourage Riley to make friends with popular hockey player Val Ortiz, straining her friendship with Bree and Grace. The old emotions escape the vault and split up; Sadness uses a recall tube to return to Headquarters while the others go to the back of Riley's mind to retrieve her old Sense of Self.\n",
      "After Riley sneaks into Coach Roberts' office and discovers from Roberts' notebook that she does not consider Riley ready to become a Firehawk, Anxiety determines to take further control. The old emotions make it to the back of Riley's mind and find a mountain of bad memories deposited by Joy's mechanism. They retrieve Riley's Sense of Self and, with no other way to get back in time, cause an avalanche of bad memories that carries them back to Headquarters before spilling into Riley's Sense of Self. Anxiety is shocked to discover that, despite her intentions, she has caused the new Sense of Self to evolve into one of self-doubt, leading to her frantically controlling Riley during a crucial hockey game. This results in Riley performing poorly and accidentally hurting Grace, getting her sent to the penalty box. Horrified, a frenzied Anxiety swarms the console in a blinding whirlwind, causing an overwhelmed Riley to suffer a panic attack.\n",
      "The old emotions finally return to Headquarters, and Joy convinces Anxiety that she does not need to make Riley change for her to have a better future. Anxiety relents and the original Sense of Self is reinstalled, but Riley's attack persists. After the repentant Anxiety admits that she cannot determine who Riley is, Joy realizes that the same, likewise, applies to her. She removes the first Sense of Self again, allowing a new, complex, and varying Sense of Self to form from Riley's positive and negative memories. Together, the emotions accept and embrace this third Sense of Self, finally allowing Riley to calm down and reconcile with Bree and Grace. The console directly calls for Joy, who takes command and helps Riley happily finish the game.\n",
      "Some time later, Riley attends high school and becomes friends with Val and the other Firehawks while staying true to herself and maintaining her friendship with Bree and Grace. Now living in peace, the first and second generations of emotions work together to protect Riley. Riley checks her phone to see if she was recruited into the Firehawks[d] and looks at herself in the mirror with a proud smile.\n",

      "Poehler accepted an offer of $5 million with lucrative bonuses to reprise her role as Joy from the first film. Phyllis Smith and Lewis Black also reprise their roles from the first film, voicing Sadness and Anger, respectively.[6] Following a dispute over pay, both Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling declined to reprise their respective roles as Fear and Disgust; they and the rest of the returning cast were reportedly offered $100,000 each, equivalent to two percent of Poehler's salary.[27] On November 9, 2023, with the release of the teaser trailer, it was revealed that Tony Hale and Liza Lapira would replace Hader and Kaling as Fear and Disgust, respectively, while Maya Hawke joined the cast as Anxiety, a new emotion.[5] Mann auditioned Hawke via Zoom at the office of a back room in Epcot during a family vacation with his kids after Nielsen told him that Hawke was available to audition just then, with her anxious performance driving him to tears.[28] On January 16, 2024, it was revealed that June Squibb had joined the cast in an undisclosed role,[13] later revealed to be Nostalgia.[12]\n",
      "On March 7, 2024, Disney revealed that Ayo Edebiri, Adèle Exarchopoulos, Paul Walter Hauser, Kensington Tallman, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan joined the cast, with Edebiri, Exarchopoulos, and Hauser playing the other new emotions, Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment, respectively.[6] In addition, Tallman replaces Kaitlyn Dias as Riley Andersen, while Lane reprises her role as Mrs. Andersen, and MacLachlan also reprises his role as Mr. Andersen.[6] John Ratzenberger reprises his role as Fritz, marking his first voice role in a Pixar film since Onward.[29] Also joining the cast in supporting roles are Lilimar, who plays a hockey player named Valentina, and Yvette Nicole Brown, who plays the coach of the hockey team, while Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green and Grace Lu play Bree and Grace, Riley's friends.[6][7]\n",

      "Box office\n",
      "As of June 24, 2024, Inside Out 2 has grossed $369.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $392.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $761.9 million.[3][4]\n",
      "On a budget of $200 million, Inside Out 2 was initially projected to gross $80–90 million in its domestic opening weekend. The sub-$100 million industry projections were partially due to the notion that general audiences remained hesitant to return to theaters, given the direct-to-streaming releases of the Pixar films Soul (2020), Luca (2021), and Turning Red (2022) on Disney+, the underperformance of Pixar's Lightyear at the box office in 2022, and the lackluster box office results of several films in 2024.[2][44][45] After making $63.6 million on its first day,[46] including an estimated $13 million from Thursday night previews, projections were raised to $140–150 million for the weekend.[47] It ended up grossing $154.2 million domestically from 4,440 theaters and an estimated $140 million from 38 international markets, for a worldwide debut of $294.2 million, the highest in Pixar history.[48][49]\n",
      "In the United States and Canada, the $154.2 million opening weekend was the best of 2024, surpassing Dune: Part Two ($82.5 million) and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire ($80 million) to become the first film of the year to open above $100 million, and the third-best for an animated film behind Pixar's own Incredibles 2 (2018; $182.7 million) and Disney's The Lion King (2019; $191.7 million).[e] It was also the fourth-best opening for a PG film after The Lion King, Incredibles 2, and Beauty and the Beast ($174 million). With an average ticket price of $12.53 overall and $10.36 for children, twelve million moviegoers saw the film in its first weekend, nearing the thirteen million admissions for Barbie (2023) in its first three days. It played strongly throughout the day (22% of viewers attended before 1 pm, 35% between 1 pm and 5 pm, 26% between 5 pm and 8 pm, and 17% after 8 pm), benefiting from substantial walk-up business credited to its multi-cultural pull (of the opening weekend audience, 36% identified as Hispanic and Latino). IMAX and Premium Large Formats (PLFs) accounted for 43% of the earnings, while 14% came from 3D showings.[47][48][50] The film found momentum during the weekday, bringing its seven-day total to $255.2 million and reaching multiple box-office milestones,[53] including the second highest-grossing first Monday for a Pixar film (at $22.4 million),[54][55] the highest-grossing first Tuesday for an animated film (at $28.8 million),[56][57] the third highest non-opening Wednesday after Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015; $38 million) and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019; $32.2 million) that doubled as a record for the Juneteenth federal holiday since it began in 2021 (at $30.1 million),[58][59] and the highest-grossing first Thursday for a Pixar film (at $19.6 million).[60][61]\n",
      "The film made $101.2 million in its second weekend, a mere 34.4% drop to become the most profitable second weekend for an animated film, surpassing the $92.3 million earned by The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023), and the seventh-best second weekend overall. Deadline Hollywood credited the feat to rainstorms and heat waves prompting people to visit air-conditioned theaters.[62][63]\n",

      "Context: [Document(page_content='Inside Out is a 2015 American animated coming-of-age film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. Produced by Jonas Rivera, it was directed by Pete Docter from a screenplay he co-wrote with Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley. The film stars the voices of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Kaitlyn Dias, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan. Inside Out follows the inner workings of the mind of Riley, a young girl who adapts to her family\\'s relocation as five personified emotions administer her thoughts and actions.\\nDocter conceived Inside Out in October 2009 after observing changes in his daughter\\'s personality as she grew older. The project was subsequently green-lit, and Docter and co-director Ronnie del Carmen developed the story, while consulting psychologists and neuroscientists in an effort to accurately portray the mind. Development took five-and-a-half years on a budget of approximately $175\\xa0million. Significant changes to the film\\'s story and characters delayed the film\\'s production schedule.\\nInside Out debuted at the 68th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2015, and was released in the United States on June 19. It received acclaim for its craftsmanship, screenplay, subject matter, plot, and vocal performances—particularly those of Poehler, Smith, Kind, Hader, Kailing and Black. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Inside Out one of the top-ten films of 2015. It grossed $858.8\\xa0million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2015. The film was nominated for two awards at the 88th Academy Awards, winning Best Animated Feature, and received numerous other accolades. Philosophical journal Film and Philosophy recognized Inside Out as one of the best animated films ever made. A sequel, Inside Out 2, was released on June 14, 2024.\\nPlot\\nIn the mind of a young girl named Riley are a series of personified basic emotions that influence her actions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Riley\\'s experiences become memories that are stored as colored orbs and are sent into long-term memory each night. The aspects of the five most-important \"core memories\" within her personality take the form of five floating islands. Joy acts as the leader; because she perceives Sadness as an unnecessary burden for Riley, Joy also works to limit Sadness\\'s influence.\\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves from Minnesota to San Francisco for her father\\'s new job. At first, she has poor experiences: the new house is cramped and old; her father hardly has any time for Riley; a local pizza parlor only serves pizza topped with broccoli, which she dislikes; and the moving van with their belongings was misdirected to Texas and will not arrive for weeks. On Riley\\'s first day at her new school, Sadness retroactively saddens joyous memories, causing Riley to cry in front of her class and creating a sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of this memory using a pneumatic tube, but accidentally knocks loose the other core memories during a struggle with Sadness, disabling the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are subsequently sucked out of Headquarters.\\nIn the absence of Joy and Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are forced to take control of Riley; they try to make happy core memories, but the results are disastrous, distancing Riley from her parents, peers, and hobbies. Without the core memories, Riley\\'s personality islands gradually crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where things fade to non-existence as they are forgotten. Anger, intending to restore Riley\\'s happiness, convinces Disgust and Fear that Riley should run away to Minnesota.\\nWhile navigating the vast long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley\\'s imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. After several adventures and mishaps, the trio catches the train, but it entirely derails when another island collapses. Joy, who is afraid all of the core memories will become sad, abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters. The ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and sending Joy and Bing Bong plunging into the Memory Dump. After discovering a sad memory of losing a hockey game that turned happy when Riley\\'s parents and friends comforted her, Joy finally understands Sadness\\'s purpose in alerting others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong\\'s song-fueled wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump. They are unable to fully ascend due to their combined weight, but Bing Bong sacrifices himself to save Joy by jumping out at the last moment.\\nJoy reunites with Sadness, and they return to Headquarters, where they discover Anger\\'s idea has disabled the console, putting Riley into depression as she boards a bus to Minnesota. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it and prompt Riley to return to her parents. As Sadness re-installs the core memories, transforming them from happy to sad, Riley tearfully tells her parents she misses her old life. Riley\\'s parents comfort her and tell her they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory that is both happy and sad, and a new island forms, representing Riley\\'s acceptance of her new life in San Francisco. A year later, Riley, now aged 12, has adapted to her new home, made new friends, returned to playing hockey and has acquired new hobbies. Inside Headquarters, Riley\\'s emotions admire her new personality islands and are given a newly expanded console that has enough room for all of them to work together.\\nVoice cast\\n\\t•\\tAmy Poehler as Joy \\t•\\tPhyllis Smith as Sadness \\t•\\tRichard Kind as Bing Bong \\t•\\tBill Hader as Fear \\t•\\tLewis Black as Anger \\t•\\tMindy Kaling as Disgust \\t•\\tKaitlyn Dias as Riley \\t•\\tDiane Lane as Mom \\t•\\tKyle MacLachlan as Dad \\t•\\tPaula Poundstone as Forgetter Paula \\t•\\tBobby Moynihan as Forgetter Bobby \\t•\\tPaula Pell as Dream Director and Mom\\'s Anger \\t•\\tDave Goelz as Subconscious Guard Frank \\t•\\tFrank Oz as Subconscious Guard Dave \\t•\\tJosh Cooley as Jangles \\t•\\tFlea as Mind Worker Cop Jake \\t•\\tJohn Ratzenberger as Fritz \\t•\\tCarlos Alazraqui as a helicopter pilot and Dad\\'s fear \\t•\\tPeter Sagal as Clown\\'s Joy \\t•\\tRashida Jones as Cool Girl\\'s emotions\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\n\\n\\nPete Docter (left) and Ronnie del Carmen in 2009\\nDevelopment of Inside Out was green-lit in October 2009[1] after director Pete Docter noticed his daughter Elie becoming \"more quiet and reserved\",[2] and began to wonder what was happening internally.[3][4] Docter invited Ronnie del Carmen, who had worked as story supervisor on Finding Nemo (2003) and Up (2009), to join the project as co-director, a role del Carmen accepted.[5][6] They sought inspiration from their own personal histories and experiences,[7] and conferred with psychologists and specialists such as psychologist Paul Ekman and Dacher Keltner, professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, for accuracy.[8][9] While designing Riley\\'s mental landscape, they consulted neuroscientists, and took cues from DNA strands and photographs of neuronal flashes.[1] According to Keltner and Ekman, the film emphasizes the ways emotions organize our thoughts and social lives, especially the role of sadness in fostering connections.[10]\\nTwenty-seven emotions—including irritation, envy, greed, gloom, despair, depression, love, schadenfreude, ennui, shame, embarrassment, and hope—were considered for early versions of the film, but the number was later reduced for the sake of simplicity.[b] Ekman supplied a list of emotions—anger, fear, sadness, disgust, contempt, surprise, and happiness—and Docter decided to remove surprise due to its similarity to fear; he also removed contempt. Happiness was renamed Optimism and later Joy.[8][16][17] Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter offered little input to the film due to his focus on restructuring Walt Disney Animation Studios; it was the first Pixar film to be produced without involvement from the studio\\'s co-founder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011.[2] The film\\'s development process took five-and-a-half years[18][19] and had a budget of approximately $175\\xa0million.[20] Ralph Eggleston, Pixar\\'s production designer since 1992, stated it was the hardest and longest film he had ever worked on.[19] As a result, first-time directors were considered ineligible to work on the film.[21]\\nWriting\\nThe filmmakers were responsible for expressing the characters\\' personal traits, talents,[11] and contrasts.[26] Inside Out\\'s design team researched more of Riley\\'s personality\\'s distinct directions after Docter became concerned over Joy\\'s displeasure. Designer Albert Lozano wanted Joy to be tomboyish and mischievous.[32] Amy Poehler helped the team write Joy, illustrating a broad range of happiness after facing difficulties. With LeFauve\\'s help, the team envisioned Joy as a vulnerable, intangible character because she is \"unapologetically positive\".[22][33] From the outset, the idea of Joy\\'s potential to excessively manipulate youth, persisted, setting off Riley\\'s \"social storms\".[34]\\nIn one instance, Riley was to have wanted the lead role as a turkey in a Thanksgiving Day pageant; Docter found that plot idea to be too unfamiliar and sought something to replace it. Several drafts emerged, including the characters cultivating ideas after falling to \"Idea Fields\";[35] in another, Bing Bong would recruit at a large, exiled entourage of characters from Riley\\'s childhood. Richard Kind later defined his character as \"the fading of childhood\" when Inside Out\\'s development had progressed.[36] In October 2011, Diane Disney Miller persuaded Docter to reduce Inside Out\\'s distractions and reprioritize the story.[22] Docter determined the concept of personality islands could integrate the mind world\\'s geography and story.[35]\\nIn 2012, the film was put into production[1] after several screenings and suggestions, and was evaluated after three months. Editor Kevin Nolting said seven versions of the film were created before the production began.[31] Balancing the film\\'s tone, for example, viewers\\' responses to Joy\\'s cheerful nature while feeling negative about the mess Joy manipulates in Riley, was difficult. Producer Jonas Rivera credited Poehler for developing these aspects of Joy\\'s nature.[34] Eggleston recommended setting the film in Riley\\'s mind rather than in her brain,[37] and a few scenes about the brain were dropped.[11]\\nPixar filmmakers held an evaluation screening of the film in July 2012. An early version of Inside Out focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together. Docter deemed this problematic and determined the idea about Joy had learned from Fear to develop her characterization, before deciding to integrate emotions and relationships within the film. Instead, Sadness replaced Fear to have a \"much juicier\" role.[11][38] Docter\\'s altercation between Joy and Sadness lacked the film\\'s emotional ending. To address the issue, he changed a scene where Riley is separating from her friend in its subsequent portions. Islands of Friendship and Personality became Joy and Sadness\\'s outings in the film to maintain its continuity.[39]\\nCasting\\nInside Out\\'s principal characters were cast in August 2013.[41] \\nEggleston was tasked with outlining the mind and real worlds through design briefs. The mind world incorporates soft surfaces, increased use of saturated colors and contrasty light, and translucency whereas the real world uses opposite attributes.[19] The worlds\\' design resembles those of Pixar films Up and Toy Story 3 (2010),[16] the romantic drama One from the Heart (1982), David Hockney\\'s theatrical productions,[53] and the intended 1950s Broadway musicals.[2] Supervising animator Victor Navone tightened the design\\'s aspects,[16] which were emphasized by freeform surface modeling.[54] Around 300 designs of Headquarters were developed.[1] Decoding how to depict the mind\\'s interior, the filmmakers concentrated on the word \"electrochemical\" and considered options using electricity.[55]\\nCharacter designs underwent several revisions before they were finalized. Simple shapes were initially designed; these included Anger as a brick, Joy as a star, Sadness as a tear, and Fear as a nerve. Sadness\\'s appearance was eventually changed to that of Debbie Downer. Lozano planned to dress Sadness in pajamas to highlight her depression. Disgust\\'s and Anger\\'s approaches were respectively based on April Ludgate and Hades from Hercules (1997). To avoid similarities to Tinker Bell, Joy was given a green dress and her hair color was changed to blue. After Pixar presented potential designs of Riley to the audience, Lozano thought the character looked like Elie.[52][56]\\nAnimation\\nAnimation of Inside Out took a year and a half. About 48 animators, including supervisors Shawn Krause and Navone, and director Jamie Roe and 350 artists—35 of them lighting–led by cinematographer Kim White–and 10 layout—and technicians were involved in the production. Two animation teams were assembled: one for the abstract sequence and another involving crowd simulation for the character groupings.[16][18] They used novel technology to locate every part of the human body.[57]\\nDocter imagined with emotions for characters, they could \"push the level of caricature\" to both design and style of movement. To this end, they emulated the animation styles of Tex Avery and Chuck Jones.[35] Docter informed Krause and Navone to push the graphic caricature of each character rather than sticking to the rigid behavior of each RenderMan model. This required an artist to draw over characters in Inside Out using a Wacom Cintiq during dailies.[58] After the characters\\' forms were finalized, they were proposed for 3D models using desktop computers. The filmmakers studied dailies until Docter gave the film\\'s finalized shots approval on lighting and rendering.[1]\\nInside Out made increased use of an advanced sketching tool with which animators performed rapid sculpting on silhouettes, altering the characters\\' appearances and evaluating a \"fine-tuning\" cloth stimulation.[59] Through the simulation department, the motion of the characters\\' hair and garments was added.[11] Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull felt the characters\\' attributes have to a lesser extent humanoid forms, bright colors, and strange shapes due to their possession of force fields.[60] All aspects of Inside Out were eventually merged into a single image,[11] becoming an animation spread across 1,600 shots. Each three seconds of footage took three weeks to create[1] and 33 hours to render.[60]\\nBoth animation teams handled the transition of Joy from a \"complete abstract\" to an \"animatable character\".[61] Lighting Joy was Eggleston\\'s early inspiration through his production design. Eggleston\\'s pastel diagram shaped Joy, increasing her illumination[62] and making her Pixar\\'s crucial character. Instead of being solid, Joy\\'s effervescence was derived from pinwheels, Champagne, and sparklers. Lozano thought Joy looked like Audrey Hepburn.[1] For Joy to become brightened, the RenderMan team developed geometrical optics,[62] and Docter suggested designing her with \"sprite-like and golden\" modifications.[30] These effects function dependably due to Joy\\'s typical type. Over 750 shots were made using artistic performance and lighting cinematography.[61] The filmmakers worked on Joy\\'s aura for eight months but encountered difficulties with time and budget. Lasseter requested that it be applied for each emotion instead. Eggleston described this technique, saying \"You could hear the core technical staff just hitting the ground, the budget falling through the roof\".[63] Docter and his six-designer team spent approximately 18 months finalizing Joy\\'s look.[32] The process of making Joy took three years.[30]\\nMusic and sound design\\n\\nComposer Michael Giacchino in 2017\\nMichael Giacchino composed the music for Inside Out.[67] He began planning in January 2015[68] and concluded in May 2015.[1] While in the music session, Docter felt its score was \"bittersweet\" and \"nostalgic\".[22] Giacchino wanted to create something more emotionally monumental for Inside Out than his score from Up.[68] The producers first met with Giacchino to discuss the film\\'s concept and screen it for him. In response, Giacchino composed an eight-minute suite of music, unconnected to the film, based on his emotions viewing it. Rivera said because both Giacchino and Docter were musicians, they discussed the film in terms of story and character.[35] In accordance with his creative preference, sound designer Ren Klyce created a progressive soundscape.[69] Audio mixing was done to harmonize \"dense\" sounds for the film\\'s beginning scene. The introduction of Joy uses a single sound.[70]\\nRelease\\nMarketing\\nMarketing Inside Out was considered difficult despite the enthusiasm of executives at Disney and Pixar for the film.[38] Writing for The Washington Post, Kristen Page-Kirby described this as \"absolutely screwed\".[71] Disney\\'s marketing strategy included an active social media campaign,[72] a worldwide publicity tour,[73] and the creation of five colorful character posters.[74] Kind did not take part in Inside Out\\'s marketing because the producers decided to keep Bing Bong a secret.[48] As a result, the character was excluded from the film\\'s promotion to focus on the emotion characters. Docter considered Kind\\'s decision \"smart\", recognizing Bing Bong was a \"surprise to the audience\".[75][76] In the run-up to its release, the film was test-screened for children because executives were worried about its appeal to young viewers.[33] Disney Infinity 3.0 added a platformer-type Inside Out playset featuring all five emotion characters as playable characters.[77][78] A mobile Puzzle Bobble-style game titled Inside Out: Thought Bubbles was released.[79][80]\\nThe 95-minute film Inside Out debuted in a competition at the 68th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2015,[81][82] followed by a premiere on June 8 at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles.[83] In the event at Cannes, the film received an eight-minute standing ovation.[84][85] Inside Out was also released in Dolby Vision, making it one of the earliest films to adopt the format.[86] In theaters, it was accompanied by a short film called Lava (2014).[87]\\nInside Out was initially scheduled for release on May 30, 2014,[88] but was postponed to June 19, 2015.[89] During its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, Inside Out grossed $90.4 million across 3,946 theaters, 3,100 of which were in 3D, debuting at number two behind Jurassic World ($106.6\\xa0million).[90] This revenue included $3.7\\xa0million from Thursday night previews.[91] The weekend-total figure made Inside Out the first Pixar film not to debut at number one,[92] the biggest number-two debut of all time (surpassing The Day After Tomorrow), and the largest opening weekend for any original film (surpassing Avatar), and was Pixar\\'s second-biggest opening after Toy Story 3.[93] Inside Out\\'s successful opening was attributed to its Cannes premiere, CinemaCon, and Fathom Events screenings, favorable critical reception and word-of-mouth, and its release over the Father\\'s Day weekend. It primarily drew a mostly female audience and approximately 71 percent of the viewers were families.[94][95][96] The film grossed $52.1\\xa0million in its second weekend—a reduction of 42\\xa0percent—and $29.3\\xa0million in its third.[97][98] After finishing its theatrical run on December 10, 2015, Inside Out had grossed $356.9\\xa0million in the U.S. and Canada as the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year.[99][100] In July 2020, due to the worldwide closure of cinemas during the COVID-19 pandemic and limits on which films played, Inside Out returned to 442 theaters—mostly drive-ins—and grossed $340,000.[101]\\nOutside the U.S. and Canada, Inside Out grossed $40.3\\xa0million during its opening weekend in 37 markets.[102] Its top-grossing markets were China at $11.7\\xa0million,[103] the United Kingdom at $11.5\\xa0million,[104] Mexico at $8.6\\xa0million, Russia at $7.6\\xa0million,[102] Italy at $7.4\\xa0million,[105] Germany at $7.1\\xa0million,[106] and South Korea at $5.2\\xa0million. Inside Out was the first Pixar film to gross over one billion rubles in Russia.[107] The film grossed a further $501.9\\xa0million, its highest grosses coming from the United Kingdom ($59.4\\xa0million), Japan ($33\\xa0million), Germany ($31.6\\xa0million), Mexico ($31.1\\xa0million), South Korea ($30.9\\xa0million), France ($30.1\\xa0million), Italy ($27.1\\xa0million), Venezuela ($25.4\\xa0million), and Australia ($24.2\\xa0million).[99] This made it the seventh-highest-grossing film outside the U.S. and Canada,[108] and the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2015 with a total gross of $858.8\\xa0million.[109] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film\\'s net profit as $279.51\\xa0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participation, and other costs; box-office grosses and home-media revenues placed it sixth on their list of 2015\\'s \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[20]\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nInside Out received critical acclaim,[d] and was listed on many critics\\' top-ten lists in 2015.[129] It has an approval rating of 98% based on 384 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.9/10. The consensus reads, \"Inventive, gorgeously animated, and powerfully moving, Inside Out is another outstanding addition to the Pixar library of modern animated classics\".[130] \\nCritics praised Inside Out\\'s craftsmanship and Docter\\'s direction,[e] describing it as a return to form for Pixar.[f] Peter Debruge (Variety), Kenneth Turan (Los Angeles Times), and Todd McCarthy (The Hollywood Reporter) praised the film. Debruge and Turan described it as Pixar\\'s best, calling it \"sophisticated\" and \"audacious\". \\nAccolades\\n\\nAt the 88th Academy Awards, Inside Out received a nomination for Best Original Screenplay and won Best Animated Feature.[166] Its other nominations include fourteen Annie Awards (winning ten),[167] two British Academy Film Awards (winning one),[168] three Critics\\' Choice Movie Awards (winning one),[169] and a Golden Globe Award (which it won).[170] The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Inside Out one of the ten-best films of 2015; it also won the National Board of Review\\'s Best Animated Film award.[171][172]\\nPost-release\\nThematic analysis\\nA central theme of Inside Out is the consequences and portrayal of emotions and memories.[173][174][175] Those depicted in the film are \"honest\" and \"generous\";[174][176] their goal is maintaining Riley\\'s life.[177] Natasha Moore of the Australian ABC News said of the film\\'s theme: \"[If] Riley\\'s carefree life gets more complicated,\\xa0... Joy\\'s attempts to deliver uninterrupted happiness become increasingly neurotic\".[178] Nicole Markotic said the film explores the relationship between \"the many and the one\", demonstrating people have \"composite\" personalities. The different components of one person\\'s personality are vital for that person\\'s \"emotional and psychological balance\". Depression and sadness are distinct in the film; this distinction is meant to \"[offer] individuals strategies to avoid suppressing crucial feelings\".[179] Writing in the British Journal of Psychiatry, Hannah Marcarian and Paul O. Wilkinson said this validation of different emotions helps people express themselves.[180]\\nRuth Bettelheim of USA Today wrote human responses to physical and social environments evolved over millions of years and are yet fully understood, as shown by the film\\'s omission of Riley\\'s bodily sensations and their possible effect on mental states. Primatologist Louise Barrett said the film shows disconnection between characters who are not relating to each other or to their own emotions but moments of personal harmony lead to positive interpersonal connections.[181] According to USA Today\\'s Jamie Altman, Inside Out shows major environmental changes can be \"difficult, but not impossible, to overcome\", recommending it to college students experiencing homesickness or sadness.[182]\\nLawsuits\\nThree lawsuits followed Inside Out\\'s release. Pediatrician Denise Daniels sued Disney and Pixar in 2017, claiming the film\\'s personified emotions infringed on her pitch for a television series called The Moodsters.[183] Two similar suits followed in 2018; author Carla J. Masterson sued Disney for infringing her books What’s on the Other Side of the Rainbow? and The Secret of the Golden Mirror,[184] and another was brought in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by a Canadian student Damon Pourshian, who had made a film titled Inside Out.[185][186] Pourshian\\'s suit was approved by an Ontario court in 2021.[187] The outcomes of these lawsuits is unknown[184][187] and Daniels\\' was rejected.[188]\\nLegacy\\nIn 2015, Google started a Made with Code event for Inside Out named \"Inside HQ\" to encourage children, especially girls, to study programming.[203] Worldwide, it was among the top entertainment Google searches of 2015.[204][205] The film is referenced in the television series The Simpsons.[206][207] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Inside Out was one of the 35 films recommended by The Independent.[208]\\nInside Out inspired several Internet memes. A meme implying a similarity between Joy and Disgust and the Philippine supercouple nicknamed AlDub was posted on social media in 2015.[209] Riley\\'s mother and maternal characters from other Pixar films were shown in a buttocks-themed \"Dump-Truck\" meme.[210]\\nThe concept of \"core memories\" became an expression used among Gen Z and later a trend on video-sharing service TikTok in mid-2022.[211][212]\\nSequel\\nMain article: Inside Out 2\\nDocter was germinating ideas for an Inside Out sequel while the original film\\'s nominations were unveiled at the 88th Academy Awards in January 2016.[213] Disney began development with an announcement at the D23 Expo in 2022.[214] Kelsey Mann took over as the sequel\\'s director and implemented Docter\\'s \"five to 27 emotions\" idea.[12][215] The sequel, Inside Out 2, was released on June 14, 2024.[214]\\nTelevision series\\nA television series based on Inside Out is in development at Pixar.

The sequel to Inside Out (2015), it was directed by Kelsey Mann (in his feature directorial debut) and produced by Mark Nielsen, from a screenplay written by Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein, and a story conceived by Mann and LeFauve. Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan reprise their roles from the first film, with Maya Hawke, Kensington Tallman, Tony Hale, Liza Lapira, Ayo Edebiri, Lilimar, Grace Lu, Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green, Adèle Exarchopoulos, and Paul Walter Hauser joining the cast. The film tells the story of Riley\\'s emotions as they find themselves joined by new emotions that want to take over Riley\\'s head.\\nFirst announced in September 2022 during the D23 Expo, Inside Out 2 features Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter\\'s \"five to 27 emotions\" idea from the first film that Mann pitched during its production to utilize \"truthful\" worldbuilding.\\nInside Out 2 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on June 10, 2024, and was released in theaters in the United States on June 14. The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $761.9 million worldwide. It had the third-biggest domestic opening weekend for an animated film, and is the highest-grossing film of 2024.\\nPlot\\nTwo years after her move to San Francisco,[c] Riley, now 13, is about to enter high school. Her personified emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust — have since overseen a newly-formed element of Riley\\'s mind called her \"Sense of Self\", which houses memories and feelings that form Riley\\'s beliefs. Joy, intending to fill the Sense of Self with only positive memories, has invented a mechanism that launches any negative memories to the back of Riley\\'s mind. Riley and her best friends Bree and Grace are invited to a weekend ice hockey camp where Riley hopes to qualify for her school\\'s team, the Firehawks. On the night before the camp, a \"Puberty Alarm\" sounds off, and a group of mind workers barge into Headquarters to upgrade the emotion console.\\nThe emotions discover that Riley wildly overreacts to any inputs they make to the console. Four new emotions also arrive at Headquarters and introduce themselves: Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui. Though initially friendly, the new and old emotions clash over their approaches; in particular, Joy thinks Riley should focus on having fun at the camp, while Anxiety wants Riley to win a spot on the team and make new friends, especially after learning that Bree and Grace will be attending a different high school.\\nWhile being led by Joy, Riley inadvertently causes the campers to be collectively punished by the camp\\'s strict director, Coach Roberts. Feeling that Riley needs to change her personality to fit in with the older players, Anxiety dumps the Sense of Self into the back of Riley\\'s mind and has the old emotions captured and thrown into a memory vault. She and the other new emotions then use negative memories to create a new, anxiety-focused Sense of Self and encourage Riley to make friends with popular hockey player Val Ortiz, straining her friendship with Bree and Grace. The old emotions escape the vault and split up; Sadness uses a recall tube to return to Headquarters while the others go to the back of Riley\\'s mind to retrieve her old Sense of Self.\\nAfter Riley sneaks into Coach Roberts\\' office and discovers from Roberts\\' notebook that she does not consider Riley ready to become a Firehawk, Anxiety determines to take further control. The old emotions make it to the back of Riley\\'s mind and find a mountain of bad memories deposited by Joy\\'s mechanism. They retrieve Riley\\'s Sense of Self and, with no other way to get back in time, cause an avalanche of bad memories that carries them back to Headquarters before spilling into Riley\\'s Sense of Self. Anxiety is shocked to discover that, despite her intentions, she has caused the new Sense of Self to evolve into one of self-doubt, leading to her frantically controlling Riley during a crucial hockey game. This results in Riley performing poorly and accidentally hurting Grace, getting her sent to the penalty box. Horrified, a frenzied Anxiety swarms the console in a blinding whirlwind, causing an overwhelmed Riley to suffer a panic attack.\\nThe old emotions finally return to Headquarters, and Joy convinces Anxiety that she does not need to make Riley change for her to have a better future. Anxiety relents and the original Sense of Self is reinstalled, but Riley\\'s attack persists. After the repentant Anxiety admits that she cannot determine who Riley is, Joy realizes that the same, likewise, applies to her. She removes the first Sense of Self again, allowing a new, complex, and varying Sense of Self to form from Riley\\'s positive and negative memories. Together, the emotions accept and embrace this third Sense of Self, finally allowing Riley to calm down and reconcile with Bree and Grace. The console directly calls for Joy, who takes command and helps Riley happily finish the game.\\nSome time later, Riley attends high school and becomes friends with Val and the other Firehawks while staying true to herself and maintaining her friendship with Bree and Grace. Now living in peace, the first and second generations of emotions work together to protect Riley. Riley checks her phone to see if she was recruited into the Firehawks[d] and looks at herself in the mirror with a proud smile.\\nVoice cast\\n\\t•\\tAmy Poehler as Joy, a yellow happy emotion[5] \\t•\\tMaya Hawke as Anxiety, a new orange anxious emotion[5] \\t•\\tKensington Tallman as Riley Andersen, a 13-year-old girl in whose mind the emotions live[6] \\t•\\tLiza Lapira as Disgust, a green disgusted emotion[5] \\t•\\tTony Hale as Fear, a purple fearful emotion[5] \\t•\\tLewis Black as Anger, a red angry emotion[5] \\t•\\tPhyllis Smith as Sadness, a blue sad emotion[5] \\t•\\tAyo Edebiri as Envy, a new cyan envious emotion[6] \\t•\\tLilimar as Valentina \"Val\" Ortiz, a popular hockey player at Riley\\'s high school[6] \\t•\\tGrace Lu as Grace, Riley\\'s friend[7] \\t•\\tSumayyah Nuriddin-Green as Bree, Riley\\'s friend[7] \\t•\\tAdèle Exarchopoulos as Ennui, a new indigo bored emotion[6] \\t•\\tDiane Lane as Mrs. Andersen, Riley\\'s mother[5] \\t•\\tKyle MacLachlan as Mr. Andersen, Riley\\'s father[5] \\t•\\tPaul Walter Hauser as Embarrassment, a new pink embarrassed emotion[6] \\t•\\tYvette Nicole Brown as Coach Roberts, a hockey coach and head of the summer hockey camp[6] \\t•\\tRon Funches as Bloofy, a character from Riley\\'s favorite childhood TV show.

The sub-$100 million industry projections were partially due to the notion that general audiences remained hesitant to return to theaters, given the direct-to-streaming releases of the Pixar films Soul (2020), Luca (2021), and Turning Red (2022) on Disney+, the underperformance of Pixar\\'s Lightyear at the box office in 2022, and the lackluster box office results of several films in 2024.[2][44][45] After making $63.6 million on its first day,[46] including an estimated $13 million from Thursday night previews, projections were raised to $140–150 million for the weekend.[47] It ended up grossing $154.2 million domestically from 4,440 theaters and an estimated $140 million from 38 international markets, for a worldwide debut of $294.2 million, the highest in Pixar history.[48][49]\\nIn the United States and Canada, the $154.2 million opening weekend was the best of 2024, surpassing Dune: Part Two ($82.5 million) and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire ($80 million) to become the first film of the year to open above $100 million, and the third-best for an animated film behind Pixar\\'s own Incredibles 2 (2018; $182.7 million) and Disney\\'s The Lion King (2019; $191.7 million).[e] It was also the fourth-best opening for a PG film after The Lion King, Incredibles 2, and Beauty and the Beast ($174 million). With an average ticket price of $12.53 overall and $10.36 for children, twelve million moviegoers saw the film in its first weekend, nearing the thirteen million admissions for Barbie (2023) in its first three days. It played strongly throughout the day (22% of viewers attended before 1\\xa0pm, 35% between 1\\xa0pm and 5\\xa0pm, 26% between 5\\xa0pm and 8\\xa0pm, and 17% after 8\\xa0pm), benefiting from substantial walk-up business credited to its multi-cultural pull (of the opening weekend audience, 36% identified as Hispanic and Latino). IMAX and Premium Large Formats (PLFs) accounted for 43% of the earnings, while 14% came from 3D showings.[47][48][50] The film found momentum during the weekday, bringing its seven-day total to $255.2 million and reaching multiple box-office milestones,[53] including the second highest-grossing first Monday for a Pixar film (at $22.4 million),[54][55] the highest-grossing first Tuesday for an animated film (at $28.8 million),[56][57] the third highest non-opening Wednesday after Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015; $38 million) and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019; $32.2 million) that doubled as a record for the Juneteenth federal holiday since it began in 2021 (at $30.1 million),[58][59] and the highest-grossing first Thursday for a Pixar film (at $19.6 million).[60][61]\\nThe film made $101.2 million in its second weekend, a mere 34.4% drop to become the most profitable second weekend for an animated film, surpassing the $92.3 million earned by The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023), and the seventh-best second weekend overall. Deadline Hollywood credited the feat to rainstorms and heat waves prompting people to visit air-conditioned theaters.[62][63]\\nCritical response\\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 260 critics\\' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website\\'s consensus reads: \"Spicing things up with the wrinkle of teen angst, Inside Out 2 clears the head and warms the heart by living up to its predecessor\\'s emotional intelligence.\"[64] \\n')]\n",
